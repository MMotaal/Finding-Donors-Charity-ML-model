    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "A) From Fscore perspective:\n",
    "1) During training:\n",
    "    For decision trees and random forest modes, The f-score were the same during all stages of training (1%,10% and 100% of the trainning set). They were aproximately conjugate training. But an important observation can be noted is that at consuming 100% of the training set the depressed in f-score  together by approximately 10%. This gives the engineer and intution that with increasing the  consumed size of trainingset during training process the F-score drops slightly in contrast with the linear regression which has held the f-score constant without fluctuating during all stages of consuming training data. \n",
    "2) During testing:\n",
    "    In contrast to the training process, the logestic regression algorithm has shown higher fscore during testing. Further more, it has improved at the end of the testing process when the full testing dataset is tested. \n",
    "    Here three important conclusions appear, that decision trees and random forests algorithms are doing well from perspective of f-score in the early stages of training but degredation starts.The second conclusion is that logestic regression algorithm performs with higher and steady continuos improving fscore untill the end of testing all the testing dataset. The third conclusion is about the remarkable overfitting of both models of decision tree and random forests. This is clear as  results of f-score are dropping too much from training to tetsting.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) From accuracy perspective:\n",

    "1) On general scale, all three models have increase in accuracy during differnt stages of training. But similar behavior is observed to the f-score performance during training pertaining to the lower accuracy of logestic regression in comparison to the two first algorithms. The accuracy measure has larger vlaue when comapared with fscore in all cases even with logestic regression. Its noted also that logestic regression is still keeping the accuracy level constant all the way during training process along different proportions of the traning dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Also in testing, logestic regression improved slightly in accuracy with increasing the testingdataset. Linear regression again wins when talking about testing along the various stages of consuming records in testing made about overfitting the data for both models of decision trees and random forests for the same reaso of relatively heavy droping of values of accuracy from training to the low values in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B) From computational cost perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) During the training increasing amount of data records the time consumed by nature increses. But the intersting point here is that the longer period of processing the training data is attached to random forest algorithm. this reflects a fact that it's not preferred for this data set due to the big remarkable difference in the time consumed to train on the training set. so its excluded from comparison. Whie the competition is still held between logestic regression. Decision trees which performed better as a time measure in training so it wins this time.\n",
    "2) During testing, logestic regression has exhibited better performance on the time scale to decision trees algorithm. Again logestic regression wins in the testing race.\n",
    "\n",
    " General conclusion: \n",
    "We have variaty of performances but a dominant observation of being superior in testin is counted for the Logestic Regression. While Decision trees wins in perfomance of training. and Finally comes the random forest in the last stage with a big difference in time and cost of computations. It's wotrth of mention that these conclusions may differe when using different data set which may be of less number of categories.\n"

    "we have number of features (variables) and one column to make predictions of depending ofn what we have from featuTes this is carriedout by creating the followin equation to relate the all these variables to the one we want to predict something about or want to classify as in our case:\n",
    "y_hat=a0+a1*x1+a2*x2.... up to number of terms that equals the number of variables plus the first constant term. Each these terms consists of a coeffecient (a_n) mltiplied by the variable (x_n).\n",
    "before this step a preparation processing is done as we already have done i preprocessing section.\n",
    "After the step of preparing data, we can split data into training set and testingset to pave the way for the algorithm to carry out the classification. Before logging to this step, we need to talk about the technique used to convert and squeeze the prepared data to be dealt with as a zero or one value.\n",
    "For this pupose we use the segmoid function which playes the role of mapping coordinator between the the variables probailties which is restrictied to values between zero and one to the earlier mentioned equation of variables and coeffecients. Thus we transformed all varaiables to numbers that bears the probapilty of its occurenece or nogation of occurence. And with help of the segmoid fuction we translate the results of these probabilties into numbers of physical meaning at the end.\n",
    "Finally after finding the coeffecients we say congrats! now we have an equation to predict the occurence or nonoccurence of probabilitty and have found the link or relation between the various variables in our dataset. After solving the model important measures such as accuracy can be infered with the help of the algorithm. \n",

    "* I was not very close to the visualization.\n",
    "* Hours per weak: are of importance because it reflects the hours worked and hence the income in return for these working hours. I mismatched this feature for the sake of the nature of occupation itself as I thought that occupation nature will have greater effect on the weight of the income and in the same time missed the point of the balance between my ownoppinion and the minmum rate of paid per hour. on the scale of the second mismatched feature which is education number which I took the nature of education itself and the last gained degree. I think the concusing part in this point is solved by thinking a little bit about the fact that education number of years implcitly includes the the last level of education and controle it as it's usally takes alot of time to reach advanced levels of education except for the ginuous people who are in fact exceptions!. The third mismatched feature is the capital gain as when I decided to leave it I assumed it may be unclear or obvious if we collected such items of information asuch as capital gain and capital loss what is the obstackle of getting explicitly one more item about the income!. It may be a miss understanding from my side especially I am not a native English speaker.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
